The XYZ ONESEATER is a trike bicycle which frame and stearing components are mainly build out of 25mm square aluminium tubing. 

This is the Github repository providing the sources of the project as FreeCad-files (.FCStd) as well as the resulting technical drawings summarized in the pdf-document [OneSeater_Techdrawings](https://github.com/FreeCutter/XYZ_ONESEATER/blob/master/OneSeater_TechDrawings.pdf).

The original construction drawings for the XYZ ONESEATER might be downloaded [here](http://www.n55.dk/MANUALS/SPACEFRAMEVEHICLES/spaceframevehicles.html). Credits to [N55](http://www.n55.dk) and collaborator Till Wolfer.

An appetizer for the vehicles in action could be found [here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPaBOMBIfKA) and [here](https://youtu.be/3dgY7bEmk1Q). Furthermore there is a thread available on the German [velomobilforum.de](https://www.velomobilforum.de/forum/index.php?threads/eigenbau-xyz-spaceframe-vehicle.33109/).

Sharing alike as the original does the idea of this Github repository is to remix, transform, or build upon the original construction drawings provided. Thus, all of us have to distribute our contributions in this repository under the same [license](https://github.com/FreeCutter/XYZ_ONESEATER/blob/master/License%20-%20Disclaimer%20-%20Contribution.md) as the original: [CC BY-NC-SA 3.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/).

Following the idea of open source it is obvious to use an open source tool as well: [FreeCAD](https://www.freecadweb.org). <br>FreeCAD is an open-source parametric 3D modeler made primarily to design real-life objects of any size.

Starting point of this repository was to get the original construction drawings transformed to FreeCAD. 

This transformation procedure is based on the structure of the original construction plan, i.e. each single component is genrated in FreeCAD (see details in [FreeCAD workflow](https://github.com/FreeCutter/XYZ_ONESEATER/blob/master/FreeCAD%20workflow%20and%20version.md)). Subsequently the needed components are used in assembleys like frame and steering bridge resulting in the final vehicle. The resulting FreeCAD files (.FCStd-files) are published in this GitHub repository and represent the open source to generate technical drawings. It's obvious that slightly adjustments had been taken compared to the original plan. 

Thus, the both now available open source FreeCAD files as well as the resulting construction manual are the first fork of the original drawing. You could use them to start your own DIY project of reproducing a XYZ ONESEATER. If you have done any further improvements or changes please contribute them accordingly in order to get further on the road of shared open source development.

Potential fork might be the XYZ TWOSEATER which already had been introduced as THREESEATER [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/jynk9lwfgj25o40/dreisitzer.avi). However, it seems to be that FreeCAD drawings are still missing and could be added/developed/provided accordingly.

Have fun!
