# XYZ_ONESEATER

The XYZ ONESEATER is a trike bicycle which frame and stearing components are mainly build out of 25mm square aluminium tubing. 

The original construction drawings for the XYZ ONESEATER might be downloaded [here](http://www.n55.dk/MANUALS/SPACEFRAMEVEHICLES/spaceframevehicles.html).

An appetizer for the vehicles in action could be found [here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPaBOMBIfKA) and [here](https://youtu.be/3dgY7bEmk1Q). Furthermore there is a quite vivid thread available on the German velomobilforum.de [here](https://www.velomobilforum.de/forum/index.php?threads/eigenbau-xyz-spaceframe-vehicle.33109/).

Sharing alike as the original does the idea of this side is to remix, transform, or build upon the original construction drawings provided. Thus, all of us have to distribute our contributions in this repository under the same lices as the original: [CC BY-NC-SA 3.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/).

Following the idea it is obvious to use a open source tool as well: [FreeCAD](https://www.freecadweb.org).
FreeCAD is an open-source parametric 3D modeler made primarily to design real-life objects of any size.

Starting point of this repository is to get the original construction drawings transformed to FreeCAD and publish them in this repository. Doing so smaller mistakes in the original drawings should have been corrected. The now available construction manual could thus be used to start your DIY project of reproducing a XYZ ONESEATER by your own.

If you have done any further improvements or changes please contribute them here in order to get further on the road of shared open source development.

First possible fork might be the XYZ TWOSEATER which already had been introduced as THREESEATER [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/jynk9lwfgj25o40/dreisitzer.avi). However, according to my knowledge FreeCAD drawings are still missing and could be added/developed here.

#FreeCAD

The FreeCAD approache is kept simple: one real component is represented by one FreeCAD file. As square aluminium tubing are the main material for the ONESEATER the setup of the FreeCAD files should be easy to understand as well: most often the characteristic cross-section of the component (e.g. 2x2x25mm square tubing) is desinged in the Sketcher workbench inside the PartDesign workbench and subsequently extruded to a solid. Boreholes are drilled by using the Pocket tool of the PartDesign workbench. Technical drawings could be easily generated by using the TechDraw workbench. Final assembly of appropiate components to e.g. a frame or stearing subassembley could be done by using the A2plus workbench mainly by adding circularEdge constraints between the components and subassembleys respectivel.
