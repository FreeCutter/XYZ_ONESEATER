# XYZ_ONESEATER

The XYZ ONESEATER is a trike bicycle which frame and stearing components are mainly build out of 25mm square aluminium tubing. 

The original construction drawings for the XYZ ONESEATER might be downloaded [here](http://www.n55.dk/MANUALS/SPACEFRAMEVEHICLES/spaceframevehicles.html).

An appetizer for the vehicles in action could be found [here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPaBOMBIfKA) and [here](https://youtu.be/3dgY7bEmk1Q). Furthermore there is a quite vivid thread available on the German velomobilforum.de [here](https://www.velomobilforum.de/forum/index.php?threads/eigenbau-xyz-spaceframe-vehicle.33109/).

Sharing alike as the original does the idea of this side is to remix, transform, or build upon the original construction drawings provided. Thus, all of us have to distribute our contributions in this repository under the same lices as the original: [CC BY-NC-SA 3.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/).

Following the idea it is obvious to use a open source tool as well: [FreeCAD](https://www.freecadweb.org).
FreeCAD is an open-source parametric 3D modeler made primarily to design real-life objects of any size.

Starting point of this repository was to get the original construction drawings transformed to FreeCAD and publish them in this repository. Doing so smaller mistakes in the original drawings should have been corrected. Thus, the now available construction manual is the first fork of the original drawing. You could use them to start your own DIY project of reproducing a XYZ ONESEATER! Standard bicycle parts like wheels and bottom bracket are not in focus so far and might be added later.

If you have done any further improvements or changes please contribute them here in order to get further on the road of shared open source development.

First potential fork might be the XYZ TWOSEATER which already had been introduced as THREESEATER [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/jynk9lwfgj25o40/dreisitzer.avi). However, according to my knowledge FreeCAD drawings are still missing and could be added/developed here.

The applied FreeCAD workflow is kept simple and similar to a [typical PartDesign workflow](https://www.freecadweb.org/wiki/Getting_started#Working_with_the_PartDesign_and_Sketcher_workbenches):
one real component is represented by one FreeCAD file. As square aluminium tubing is the main material for the ONESEATER the setup of the FreeCAD files starts most often with the characteristic cross-section of the component (e.g. 25x25x2mm square tubing). The Sketcher workbench inside the PartDesign workbench is used to draw the cross-section. The cross-section is subsequently extruded to a solid. Boreholes are drilled to the solid by using the Pocket tool of the PartDesign workbench.
Final assembly of appropiate components e.g. to a frame or stearing subassembley could be done by using the [A2plus workbench](https://www.freecadweb.org/wiki/A2plus_Workbench). This is done mainly by adding circularEdge constraints between several components to get to subassembleys as well as constraints between several subassembleys to get to a final assembly respectively.
Screws, nuts and washers might be added in subassembleys or final assembly by using the [Fasteners](https://www.freecadweb.org/wiki/Fasteners_Workbench) workbench.

Technical drawings of components or any assembly could be easily generated by using the [TechDraw](https://www.freecadweb.org/wiki/TechDraw_Module) workbench.
