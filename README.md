## About

This branche provides improvements of the master sources of this project.

Improvements and changes regard to:  
* Fixing of bottom bracket to frame
* Steering component: introducing kingpin (roll radius) as well as more caster. The steering operation changed to 'skid steering' or 'tank steering'. 
* Seat: splitting the seat into two parts: a more confortable back rest and a plane plate
* Back wheel: Dropout and suspension by an elastomer



As I could not fork my own repository a branche is used to split the mentioned improvements from the master.

I apologize that no content is yet available. FCStd-files as well as pdf-drawings hopefully coming soon.
Purpose of this Readme.md so far is to structure the developed improvements.
