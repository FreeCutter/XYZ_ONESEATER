The XYZ ONESEATER is a trike bicycle which frame and stearing components are mainly build out of 25mm square aluminium tubing.

An appetizer for the vehicles in action could be found [here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPaBOMBIfKA) and [here](https://youtu.be/3dgY7bEmk1Q). Furthermore there is a quite vivid thread available on the German velomobilforum.de [here](https://www.velomobilforum.de/forum/index.php?threads/eigenbau-xyz-spaceframe-vehicle.33109/).

Sharing alike as the original does the idea of this side is to remix, transform, or build upon the original construction drawings provided. Thus, all of us have to distribute our contributions in this repository under the same lices as the original: [CC BY-NC-SA 3.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/).

Following the idea it is obvious to use a open source tool as well: [FreeCAD](https://www.freecadweb.org).
FreeCAD is an open-source parametric 3D modeler made primarily to design real-life objects of any size.
